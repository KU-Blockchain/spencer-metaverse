[Video demo/explanation of the site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Ld1XGUaDE)

## Features of the site:
- Users can choose coordinates using a Google maps API and then mint an NFT of the coordinates, representing a super simple claim to ownership of a piece of digital land. 
- Users can view all the deeds they own.
- Users can burn (permanently destroy) their deeds. 

## Notes to the user:
- The site is made for desktop with the Metamask extension connected
- There is a single LandDeed.sol contract deployed to the Amoy testnet
- I didn't abstract gas fees (sorry) meaning the site will require your wallet to have a bit of Amoy Matic, which you can get by pasting your wallet address into a faucet like this
